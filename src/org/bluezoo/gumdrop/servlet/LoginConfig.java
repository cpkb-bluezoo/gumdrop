/**
 * Definition of a login-config.
 *
 * The login-config is used to configure the authentication method that should
 * be used, the realm name that should be used for this application, and the
 * attributes that are needed by the form login mechanism. The sub-element
 * auth-method configures the authentication mechanism for the Web application. The
 * element content must be either BASIC, DIGEST, FORM, CLIENT-CERT, or a
 * vendor-specific authentication scheme. The realm-name indicates the realm
 * name to use for the authentication scheme chosen for the Web application. The
 * form-login-config specifies the login and error pages that should be used in
 * FORM based login. If FORM based login is not used, these elements are ignored.
