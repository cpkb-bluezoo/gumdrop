This directory holds the J2EE API jars required for compilation.

These are bundled into gumdrop-container.jar at build time and loaded by the
ContainerClassLoader at runtime, ensuring servlet implementations cannot
access gumdrop's internal classes.

Note: gonzalez (XML parsing) and jsonparser (JSON parsing) sources are now
integrated directly into gumdrop with zero external dependencies.
