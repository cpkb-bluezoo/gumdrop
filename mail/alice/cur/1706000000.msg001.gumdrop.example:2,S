Hi Alice,

I'd like to schedule a kickoff meeting for the Gumdrop project.
How does Thursday at 2pm work for you?

We need to cover:
- Project scope and deliverables
- Timeline and milestones
- Resource allocation
- Risk assessment

Let me know if that time works or suggest an alternative.

Cheers,
Bob
