Bob,

The agenda looks great. Just one small addition: could we
allocate 10 minutes at the end for an open Q&A session?

Also, I've been thinking about the deployment strategy. We
should probably discuss whether we want blue-green or canary
deployments. I'll prepare a brief comparison.

See you tomorrow!

Alice
