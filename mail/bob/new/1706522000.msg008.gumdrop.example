Hi Bob,

Quick one -- are we still targeting March 15th for the beta
release? I need to coordinate with the QA team for the
regression test window and they need at least two weeks' notice.

Also, do we have sign-off from the security review yet?
That was supposed to come through last Friday.

Thanks,
Alice
